    My research sits at the intersection of <strong>industrial organization, competition policy, and energy economics</strong>[cite: 3, 6, 1810]. 
    A central strand of my work examines how minority ownership links between competing firms shape their incentives to compete, innovate, and collude[cite: 1812, 1545]. 
    I also study how information frictions and consumer search drive pricing strategies and consumer behavior, as well as the effectiveness of state aid and EU competition policy[cite: 1551, 1552]. 
    In addition, I work on the economics of the energy transition and the design of electricity markets[cite: 1810].

    My papers on these topics have been published in leading academic journals, including the 
    <em>American Economic Journal: Microeconomics</em>, <em>Journal of Public Economics</em>, 
    <em>Journal of Political Economy Microeconomics</em>, and the <em>European Economic Review</em>.

    I advise institutions such as the European Commission and the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy, 
    and serve as a court expert in cartel cases[cite: 1814].
